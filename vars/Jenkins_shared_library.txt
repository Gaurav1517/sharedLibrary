JENKINS SHARED LIBRARY 
Jenkins Shared Library is a concept of having common pipeline code in the version control
system that can be used by any number of pipelines just by referencing it. 

Create Shared Library
1. Create GitHub repo to store shared library code.

2. Create file structure like this :
(root)
+- src                     # Groovy source files
|   +- org
|       +- foo
|           +- Bar.groovy  # for org.foo.Bar class
+- vars
|   +- foo.groovy          # for global 'foo' variable
|   +- foo.txt             # help for 'foo' variable
+- resources               # resource files (external libraries only)
|   +- org
|       +- foo
|           +- bar.json    # static helper data for 					org.foo.Bar

eg.
In my case i have create this 
+vars
|------ +- hello.groovy # extension must be .groovy
	+- dockerCred.groovy

GitHub repo: https://github.com/Gaurav1517/sharedLibrary.git
sharedLibrary/vars/hello.groovy
def call(String message) {
    echo "Hello from Shared Library! Message: ${message}"
}

3. Configure in Jenkins Dashboard 
Navigate to Manage Jenkins » System » Global Trusted Pipeline Libraries to configure as many libraries as necessary.
